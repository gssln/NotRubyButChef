**Time: 50-60 min**  
**Serves: 4-6**  
These are always a treat. I go back and forth between scotch or bourbon on these, but both are fine.

# Ingredients
- 3/4 whisky
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 2 lb carrots, peeled and sliced

# Directions
In a large pot, boil the carrots for about 15 minutes, or until they're slightly soft, stirring occasionally.

Add the whisky to a large saucepan and reduce over medium heat until most of the alcohol has cooked off. Melt the butter in the scotch and stir in the maple syrup. Reduce the mixture to a glaze over medium heat.  

In a baking tray, mix the glaze and the carrots and stir to coat. Bake the carrots around 400 degrees until the glaze thickens.

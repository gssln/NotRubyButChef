**Time: 50-60 min**  
**Serves: 4-6**  
These are always a treat. Feel free to use fresh carrots for this recipe instead of frozen, but be sure to boil the slices of carrot for 5 minutes before adding them to the glaze. I go back and forth between scotch or bourbon on these, but both are fine.

# Ingredients
- 3/4 whisky
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 2 lb carrots, peeled and sliced

# Directions
In a large pot, boil the carrots for about 20 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally.

Add the whisky to a large saucepan and reduce over medium heat until most of the alcohol has cooked off. Melt the butter in the scotch and stir in the maple syrup. Reduce the mixture to a glaze over medium heat.  

In a baking tray, mix the glaze and the carrots and stir to coat. Bake the carrots around 400 degrees until the glaze thickens.

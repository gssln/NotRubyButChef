# Summary
**Time: 1 hour, 30 minutes**  
**Serves: 8**  

# Ingredients
- 8 large potatoes, peeled, cut into large wedges (about 6-7 wedges per potato)
- 4 or more garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano (to taste)
- 1 large lemon, juiced
- sea salt
- fresh coarse ground black pepper

# Directions
Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Toss ingredients together in a large baking pan. Bake for 40 minutes.  
Once a golden-brown crust has formed on the potatoes, give them a stir to bring the white underside up. Season lightly with salt, pepper, and oregano.  
Add 1/2 cup more water if pan appears to be getting dry, and pop back into oven to brown other side of potatoes, about 40 minutes.

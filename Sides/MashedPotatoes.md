We discovered that adding golden beets to mashed potatoes can only make them better.  

# Ingredients
- 1 pound russet potatoes
- 1/2 pound golden beets
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 2 ounces unsalted butter
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 egg yolk

# Directions
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.  
Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice.  
Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  
Heat the cream and butter in the microwave until warmed through, about 30 seconds.  
Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until well combined. 
Pour the potato mixture into a glass baking dish and bake until the potatoes begin to brown, approximatedly 20 to 25 min.

# Summary
**Time: 2 hours**  
**Serves: 12-14**  
When we made this last, instead of using mashed potatoes we used a mix of mashed potatoes and golden beets that we'd made for shepherds pie the night before. It was definitely the right choice.

# Ingredients
- 2 lbs baby red-skinned potatoes
- 2 stalk celery, finely chopped
- 1 sweet white onion, finely chopped
- 6 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
- 2 cup mashed potatoes/golden beets
- 2 cups mayonnaise
- 2 Tbsp dijon mustard
- salt and pepper to taste

# Directions
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain and set in the refrigerator to cool.  
Mix together the mayonnaise, mustard, and mashed potatoes.  
Chop the cooled potatoes, leaving skin on. Add to a large bowl, along with the eggs, onion and celery.  
Stir in the mayonnaise mixture and add salt and pepper to taste. Chill for an hour before serving.

Pretty simple cornbread stuffing, but it's always one of my favorites around the holidays. I usually use the cornbread recipe listed under /Sides/ but I swap out the pepper jack for shredded montery jack or a "mexican" shredded cheese blend.

# Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pound vegetarian sausage, crumbled
- 1 large sweet onion, peeled and diced
- 4 bell peppers, one of every color, seeded and diced
- 2 cups vegetable stock
- 1 pan cornbread, cut into cubes

# Directions
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  
Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned. Remove and set aside.  
Add the onion to the pan and reduce heat to medium. Continue cooking until onion begins to turn clear and soften. Add the peppers and continue cooking until peppers begin to soften.  
Pour the vegetable mixture and sausage into a large roasting pan.
Return pan to heat and deglaze with a splash of vegetable stock stock and pour the mix into the roasting pan. Add the cubed cornbread and mix by hand.
Add the rest of the vegetable stock, cover with aluminum foil, and place in the oven for 30 minutes, or until it is soft and the flavors well incorporated. Remove foil and continue to back until the top is golden, about 10 minutes.

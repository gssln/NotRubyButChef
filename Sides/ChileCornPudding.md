# Directions
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Puree 3 cups corn in a food processor. Transfer to a large bowl, and stir in remaining cup corn, the salt, scallions, chiles, flour, and 1/3 cup cheese.  

In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs and cream just until combined. Stir into corn mixture.   

Place butter in an 8-inch square baking dish, and place in oven until butter is melted, about 10 minutes. Pour batter into hot baking dish, and sprinkle top with remaining 1 2/3 cups cheese.  

Place a baking sheet on lower rack to catch any drips, and bake until puffed and bubbling and cheese is golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool 30 minutes before serving.

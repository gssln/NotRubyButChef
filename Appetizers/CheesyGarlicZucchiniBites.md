# Summary
**Time: 50 minutes**  
**Serves: 30 bites**  
I was initially incredulous about these when I first rolled them out, but they're are absolutely delicious. I usually double the recipe and double the size of the bites, but that's a personal choice.

# Ingredients
- 2 cups shredded and patted dry zucchini (from about 2 medium-sized zucchini)
- 1 1/4 cup plain panko bread crumbs
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup finely chopped green onion
- 2 tablespoons chopped dill
- 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Ranch, for serving

# Directions
Preheat oven to 400Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.  
In a large bowl, stir together the zucchini, panko bread crumbs, cheddar cheese, egg, green onion, dill, and seasonings until well-combined.  
One tablespoon at a time, press the zucchini mixture into small balls. Place onto the baking sheet and repeat until all of the zucchini mixture has been used up.  
Bake until browned and crisp, about 30 minutes, flipping halfway through.  
Serve warm with ranch, for dipping, if desired.

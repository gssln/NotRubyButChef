# Summary
**Time: a while**  
**Serves: 1 per yolk**  

# Ingredients
- 1 or more goose, duck, or chicken egg yolk
- 1 pound of sea salt (you won't need all of it)
- Cheesecloth
- Butchers twine

# Directions
For each yolk you wish to cure, make a 1/2 inch circular pile of salt in a non reactive Pyrex container. Use a spoon to make a small depression in the salt.  
Crack the egg and carefully separate the yolk from the white. Gently place the yolk into the depression. Repeat with the remaining eggs.  
Take the extra salt and completely cover the yolk by at least a 1/4 to 1/2 inch.  
Transfer the container over to the fridge and store there for a week.  
After seven days, remove the containers and carefully retrieve the yolks, using a towel to dust off as much salt as you can.  
Wrap the yolks in cheesecloth then tie with butcher's twine and hang in a cool, dark spot in your home or in your fridge for another 7-10 days.

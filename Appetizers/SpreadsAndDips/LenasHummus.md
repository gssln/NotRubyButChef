# Summary
**Time: 15-20 min**  
**Serves: 6-8**  
This is the hummus recipe that we've used in-house at Caffe Lena for several decades.  
Simple, easy, and delicious, it's extremely hard to get wrong and it's always a hit.

# Ingredients
- 1 can chickpeas, liquid reserved
- 1-2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 cup tahina/tahini
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- The faintest blush of olive oil (about 1/4 tsp, maybe less)

# Directions
Drain the can of chickpeas into a glass and save the liquid for later.  
In a food processor, add the chickpeas, garlic, lemon, tahina, salt, and about half the liquid from the chickpeas.  
Pulse until fine, adding the olive oil and continuing to add the chickpea liquid slowly until you reach the desired consistency.  

Feel free to drizzle a bit of olive oil over the hummus once it's plated for presentation's sake, and garnish with a slice of lemon.  
Serve with veggies, warm pita, and/or just a dash of olive tapenade.

**Time: 15 min prep, plus chill time**  
**Serves: Hungry People**  
Almost idiot-proof spinach dip. I usually make my own sourdough for this, but any store-bought loaf will do just fine.

# Ingredients
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 1 (16 ounce) container sour cream
- 1 (1.8 ounce) package dry leek or vegetable soup mix
- 1 (4 ounce) can water chestnuts, drained and chopped
- 1 (2 ounce) small jar diced pimentos, drained
- 1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained
- 1 (1 pound) loaf round sourdough bread

# Directions
In a medium bowl, mix together mayonnaise, sour cream, dry leek soup mix, water chestnuts and chopped spinach. Chill in the refrigerator 3-6 hours, or overnight. Basically however long you like.  
Remove top and interior of sourdough bread. Fill with mayonnaise mixture. Tear removed bread chunks into pieces for dipping. If you're like me and don't remember to proof your bread properly half the time, set out extra crackers to compensate for your lack of excess bread.

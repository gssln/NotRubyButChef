# Summary
**Time: 1.5hr**  
**Serves: 8-12**  
I know I've said I never wing it, but hey I winged it. Still iterating on this one.

# Ingredients
- salt
- 2 zucchini / summer squash, chopped into quarters
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 lbs crimini mushrooms, coarsely chopped
- 2 medium onions or 4 medium shallots, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, slivered
- 1 cup toasted walnuts
- black pepper, to taste

# Directions
Ask the gods not to smite you for your culinary hubris and dive right in to making this thing up as you go along.  

Place zucchini in a colander, toss with salt and set aside to drain in sink or over a bowl 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy sauté pan and saute the mushrooms until they've shrunk to about half their size, around 10 min. Add your onions and garlic to the pan and continue to cook until the onion becomes soft.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Rinse, drain, and pat dry the zucchini and add to the pan. Sauté about 20 minutes, until the zucchini reaches a spreadable consistency. Remove from heat and allow the pan to cool about 5 minutes.

While the vegetables are cooling, spread the walnuts in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast for 5 to 10 minutes, until they appear a shade darker and smell toasty. Let cool completely before using.

Empty the contents of your pan into a food processor and blend the vegetables until you have a smooth paste. Add the toasted walnuts and continue to pulse until the walnuts are processed to your desired consistency. Add pepper to taste - the salted zucchini should leave things salty enough, but you can add more here if you think you need to.

**Notes:**  
If you burn the vegetables a bit and then, like an idiot, mix the burned bits back into the rest of the vegetables like I did the first time, you can add acid to help hide the burnt flavor...then a bunch of different dairy ingredients you had floating around and a pinch of sugar because now it's too acidic. Regret winging things in the first place and add, approximately:  
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 c ricotta
- 1/4 c heavy cream
- 1 tsp unsalted butter
- 1 tsp sugar

Alternatively, you could keep an eye on things so they don't burn in the first place...or if you can't manage that, just don't be an idiot and remove the unburned vegetables into another pan instead of mixing in all the gross bits like I did.

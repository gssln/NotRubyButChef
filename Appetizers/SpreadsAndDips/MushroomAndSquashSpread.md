I know I said I never wing it, but hey I winged it. Still iterating on this one.

# Ingredients
- salt
- 2 zucchini / summer squash, chopped into quarters
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 lbs crimini mushrooms, coarsely chopped
- 2 medium onions, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced

- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 c ricotta
- 1/4 c heavy cream
- 1 tsp unsalted butter

# Directions
Ask the gods not to smite you for your culinary hubris and dive right in to making this thing up as you go along.  

Place zucchini in a colander, toss with salt and set aside to drain in sink or over a bowl 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a heavy saut√© pan and saute the mushrooms until they've shrunk to about half their size, around 10 min

Run out of time and save your recipe. Promise yourself you'll update it later. Never deliver.

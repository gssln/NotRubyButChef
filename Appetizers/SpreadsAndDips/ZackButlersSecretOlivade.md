It's the easiest thing (if you have a food processor, I use my old
small and cheap one and it does just fine).

One medium container of kalamata olives from the olive bar
2-4 cloves of garlic by preference
a sprig of rosemary
enough olive oil to make it smooth

10-20 seconds of processor violence

put in a bowl and people think you know what you're doing.
You can get fancier but I never saw the need, tastes fine like this
(technically without capers it's an olivade).  Serve with a baguette.

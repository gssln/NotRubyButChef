A more Jewish twist on Spanikopita.

# Ingredients
- 10 ounces frozen chopped spinach
- 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- Kosher salt
- 2 to 4 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ tsp. ground black pepper
- 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 3 Tbsp. heavy cream
- ¾ cup chopped feta
- 1 tsp. lemon juice
- A few shakes of hot sauce
- 1 (9" to 10") piecrust, store-bought or homemade
- 1 egg yolk with a splash of water, lightly beaten
- Flaky sea salt 

# Directions
Preheat oven to 425°. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set spinach on a plate at room temperature to soften slightly.  

In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion and a pinch of kosher salt. Cook, stirring often, until onion is soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and pepper and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add flour and stir to combine, then stir in heavy cream. Roughly chop spinach and stir into pot with a pinch of kosher salt. Cook, stirring, until spinach is heated through and ingredients are combined. Stir in feta, lemon juice, and hot sauce and remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired.  

On a lightly floured surface, roll out half the dough into a ¼"-thick round. Spread half the spinach mixture in an even layer. Using a pizza cutter or a knife, cut dough into 8 wedges. Roll up each section, starting at the wide end, to create a crescent shape. On prepared baking sheets, place rugelach 1" apart. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.  

Lightly brush tops of rugelach with egg wash and sprinkle with sea salt.  

Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve.

**Time: 1 hour, 20 minutes**  
**Serves: 10-12**  
Tiny twice-baked potatoes. Lemon and capers make this more refreshing and crisp, probably, but I haven't tried making it yet.

# Ingredients
- 12 small red potatoes, halved
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 2 tsp minced fresh chives, divided
- 2 tsp butter, melted
- 2 tsp finely chopped drained capers
- 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
- 2 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese

# Directions
Preheat oven to 450°.  

Combine potatoes and oil; toss to coat. Arrange potatoes, cut sides down, in a single layer on a parchment paper–lined baking sheet. Bake at 450° for 20 minutes. Turn potatoes; bake 10 minutes. Remove and cool 20 minutes.   

Preheat broiler to high.  

Using a paring knife, carefully cut a circle in the cut side of potatoes. Using a melon baller or small spoon, remove pulp from potato, leaving a thin shell. Combine pulp, sour cream, 1 tablespoon chives, and next 5 ingredients (through pepper). Evenly fill potato shells with filling; sprinkle with cheese and remaining 1 tablespoon chives.  

Broil potatoes for 2 minutes or until cheese is lightly browned.

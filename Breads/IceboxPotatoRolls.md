# Summary
**Time: 1 hour prep, 15 min bake, plus rising time**  
**Serves: 1-30**  
First time I made these I screwed up the instructions not once, not twice, but three separate times. They still came out perfectly. I love these buttery little monsters.

# Ingredients
- 1 1/4 pounds potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 3-1/2 cups)
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
- 5-1/2 to 6 cups bread flour
- 1 cup 2% milk
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup shortening
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 cup butter, melted

# Directions
Place cubed potatoes in a saucepan; add water to cover. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cook, uncovered, 10-15 minutes or until tender. Drain; return to pan. Mash potatoes (you should have about 2 cups). Cool slightly.  
In a large bowl, mix sugar, salt, yeast and 2 cups flour. In a small saucepan, heat milk, water and shortening to 100°-110°. Add to dry ingredients; beat on medium speed 2 minutes. Add eggs and potatoes; beat on high 2 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough (dough will be very sticky).  
Do not knead. Place dough in a large greased bowl. Cover with greased plastic wrap; refrigerate overnight.  
Punch down dough. Using a tablespoon dipped in melted butter, drop three spoonfuls of dough into a greased muffin cup. Repeat, re-dipping spoon in butter.  
Cover with greased plastic wrap; let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375°.  
Brush tops with remaining melted butter. Bake 12-15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool in pans 5 minutes. Remove to wire racks; serve warm. Yield: about 2-1/2 dozen.  

**Note:** Dough can be made up to 3 days before baking. Prepare dough as directed, refrigerating dough for 1-3 days and punching down dough every 24 hours. Shape and bake rolls as directed.

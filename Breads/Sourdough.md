# Summary
**Time: 30 min prep, 30 min bake, plus proof time**  
**Serves: 2 Breads**  
This bread recipe and the sourdough culture that drove it got me through college. Nowadays I usually just spin up a fresh sourdough starter about a week ahead of whenever I plan to make a few loaves.

# Ingredients
- 12.5-14 ounces sourdough culture
- 34 ounces flour
- 1/2 cup wheat germ
- 18 ounces warm water
- 4 tsp salt


# Directions
Mix together everything but your salt and knead in a bread mixer for 4 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 20 minutes.  
Slowly fold in the salt, to avoid clumps. Knead for another 4 minutes. Turn out and knead by hand for another 2-3 minutes.  
Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with greased plastic wrap, and let rise for 3 hours at room temperature.  
Turn out, divide the dough into two loaves, partially flatten to remove bubbles, form into rounds, and place into floured boules or a bowl with a floured dishtowel. Cover, making sure the top isn't touching the dough. Refridgerate 8 hours, or overnight.  
Place a large casserole dish in the oven and preheat for 1 hour at 475 degrees.  
Take bread out and uncover to let dry slightly. Flip the bread out, slice the top, and place the loaf in the casserole dish.  
Bake for 20 minutes with the lid on. Remove the lid, and continue to bake for another 10 minutes, or until the top of the loaf turns a golden-brown.  
Place the dish back in the oven and allow it to return to temperature. Repeat for the second loaf.

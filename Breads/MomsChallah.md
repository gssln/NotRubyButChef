# Summary
Mom's challah recipe

# Ingredients
- 1 Package active dry yeast
- 1 ¼ cups warm water (about 110 degrees)
- 1 teaspoon salt (sometimes I add more)
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil (not olive)
- 2 eggs slightly beaten
- 2 drops yellow food coloring or a pinch of saffron (or neither -- this is just for color)
- 4 ½ cups of flour unsifted
- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon of water (for egg wash)

# Description
In kitchenaid mixer bowl, use whisk attachment to dissolve yeast in water. Add the salt, sugar, oil, eggs, and food coloring (or saffron). Beat on medium speed for one minute.  
Change to dough hook and add the flour. Put on low speed and let machine mix in flour. Once all flour is mixed in, go up a speed (kick it up a notch), and knead for 5 minutes.  
Check dough -- if it’s nice and satiny, you’re done. If not, add ¼ cup flour and knead a bit more.  
Put dough in a large greased bowl and cover with a moist dish towel. Put on top of the radiator or someplace sort of warm. Keep it there for 1 ½ hours or until doubled in size.  
Punch it! Yes, punch the dough down right in the center. Pow!  
Then shape it however you want to, and place it on the baking pan you want to bake it on. Then let it rise for another hour.  
Using a soft brush, or your fingers (since your son took your soft brush with him when he moved to Seattle), spread egg wash over the entire surface of the challah.  
Bake at 350 for 30 minutes -- longer if it’s not as toasty brown as you’d like it to be.

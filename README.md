# NotRubyButChef
A constant iteration in the kitchen.

# General Porpoise
I recently realized my two biggest concerns with tracking my recipes:
- If I didn't have the card on-hand I didn't have the recipe
- If I made a change it wasn't always simple to roll back to a previous recipe

Then it hit me - I just needed version control and a remote repository.

# Structural Plan
For the time being, I'm sticking to a lightweight "organic" filing system, fiddling and re-filing things as I go along. It's not exactly modular, but we'll pretend that this counts as being *agile*.

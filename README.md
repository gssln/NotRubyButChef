# NotRubyButChef
A constant iteration in the kitchen.

# General Porpoise
I recently realized my two biggest concerns with tracking my recipes:
- If I didn't have the card on-hand I didn't have the recipe
- If I made a change it wasn't always simple to roll back to a previous recipe

Then it hit me - I just needed version control and a remote repository.

# Structural Plan
For the time being, I'm sticking to a lightweight filing system. Obviously this is going to have to change, but I'd rather let the system form organically rather than planning a robust filing system that ends up being inefficient. Once I hit a critical mass of recipes in the repo, I'll adapt the organizational paradigm. It won't exactly be a modular system, but we'll pretend that this counts as being *agile*.

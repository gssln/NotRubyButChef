Basic pesto, made with basil, olive oil, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese.  
Toasting the pine nuts is essential - I just do it in a dry pan.

# Ingredients
- 3 cups packed fresh basil leaves
- 4 cloves garlic
- 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts 

# Directions
Combine basil, garlic, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and nuts in the bowl of a food processor or blender. Blend to a smooth paste.

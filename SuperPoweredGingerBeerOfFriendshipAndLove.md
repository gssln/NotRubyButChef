And on the eighth day, God created ginger beer.  
Be sure to use Grolsch-style bottles and don't pitch for too long or the whole business will go boom. Recipe makes 8 16oz bottles, 4 32oz bottles, 2 64oz bottles, etc. 

# Ingredients
- 2.2L warm water
- 10 oz ginger juice
- 16 oz lemon juice
- 28 oz 1:1 simple syrup
- Champagne yeast

# Directions
Strain the lemon and ginger juices with a fine strainer or cheese cloth. Mix together everything but the yeast.  

Using the end of a paring knife, tap just a bit of champagne yeast into each bottle. You don't need much - a little goes a long way. Just a bit of champagne yeast on the tip of the knife per bottle will do. For larger bottles, slightly increase the amount of yeast.  

Fill each bottle mid-neck and seal. Shake and store in a cool, dark place for two days. Move to refridgerator and chill overnight.

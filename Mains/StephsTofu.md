This is probably my favorite marinated tofu. I grabbed this recipe back when PCC had it up on their website for free.

# Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons sunflower oil, divided
- 1/2 cup orange juice concentrate
- 1/2 cup mirin rice wine
- 1/4 cup tamari
- 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons brown rice vinegar
- 2 tablespoons finely minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons finely minced fresh ginger
- 2 pounds extra-firm tofu

# Directions
Preheat oven to 350° F. Grease a casserole dish with 1 tablespoon sunflower oil.  
Mix together remaining sunflower oil, orange juice concentrate, mirin, tamari, sesame oil, brown rice vinegar, garlic and ginger. Whisk well.  
Cut tofu into 1/2-inch cubes and marinate in the above liquid in the greased casserole dish for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. It’s best to use a wooden spoon to avoid damaging the tofu.  
Bake tofu for 1 hour, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes. Some sauce will be absorbed into the tofu while cooking. Serve hot or cold with your favorite accompaniment.

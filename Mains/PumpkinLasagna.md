Preheat oven to 375Â°. Melt butter in saucepan on low heat. Add garlic and stir until cooked but not browned, about 1 minute. Stir in pumpkin, sugar, maple syrup, spices, pepper,and salt; let simmer until completely heated.  

Stir together 10 ounces of mozzarella with ricotta.  

Smear a thin layer of pumpkin sauce on bottom of baking dish. Lay 3 sheets of lasagna down in the baking dish and spread 1/5 of the ricotta/mozzarella mixture over the lasagna sheets. Cover with 1/5 of the pumpkin sauce. Repeat this process 4 more times to create a total of 5 layers of noodles, cheese and sauce. Arrange remaining 6 ounces mozzarella cheese on top of final pumpkin-sauce layer.  

Cover with foil and bake at 375 degrees, covered, for 45 minutes; remove foil and cook for an additional 12 minutes until the cheese begins to slightly brown. Rest for 5 minutes before serving.

# Summary

This recipe is meant to sit and cook for a long while so the gravy can get just right and the meatballs can absorb some of the flavor. This recipe also scales really well. If I want to make this for more people I usually just multiply the recipe by 1.5.  

# Ingredients
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 4 Tbsp flour
- 1 pint heavy cream
- 2 cups water
- 2 tsp Better Than Boullion Vegetable Base
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 2 bags Gardein Meatless Meatballs

# Directions
In a sauce pan or dutch oven, melt the butter and add the flour, stirring to form a paste. I like to let the roux cook until it's browned.*  

Once your roux is prepared, tansfer it to the dish you'll be using for the gravy and meatballs (if you used a dutch oven, there's no need to move anything). Add the heavy cream and the water and heat the mixture over med-high until it just starts to simmer.  

Add the vegetable base, mustard, and worcestershire sauce and stir until everything is properly mixed. Submerge the meatballs in the gravy and continue to heat the dish on med-high until the gravy returns to a simmer.  

Lower the heat and simmer the gravy, covered, for as long as you'd like, stirring occaisionally.

Updates:
I tried adding rye whiskey to the gravy and cooking off the alcohol, but it ended up tasting a little off. I might try bourbon, but I think the gravy is already perfect as-is.

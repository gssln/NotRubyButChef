Based off of Alton Brown's recipe here: [https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/shepherds-pie-recipe2-1942900](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/shepherds-pie-recipe2-1942900), which uses lamb instead of fake ground beef.  
According to the internet, lamb has approximately 6g of fat per oz of grounds...a little less than 6 times more than Morningstar Farms Grillers Crumbles. You *could* add an entire stick of butter to get some of the fats back to make the gravy in the filling - I opt for half a stick, myself.  
One other important change - we tried golden beets in our mashed potatoes and they were a huge success.

# Ingredients
Mashed Potatoes:  
- 1 pound russet potatoes
- 1/2 pound golden beets
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 2 ounces unsalted butter
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 egg yolk  

Filling:  
- 2 tablespoons neutral cooking oil
- 1 med onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (12oz) bags Morningstar Farms Grillers Crumbles
- 4 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons browned tomato paste
- 1 cup Better Than Boullion vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 teaspoons freshly chopped rosemary leaves
- 1 teaspoon freshly chopped thyme leaves
- 1/2 cup frozen corn kernels
- 1/2 cup frozen English peas

# Directions
Peel the potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch dice. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. Once boiling, uncover, decrease the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender and easily crushed with tongs, approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  
Place the cream and butter into a microwave-safe container and heat in the microwave until warmed through, about 35 seconds. Drain the potatoes in a colander and then return to the saucepan. Mash the potatoes and then add the half and half, butter, salt and pepper and continue to mash until smooth. Stir in the yolk until well combined.  

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

While the potatoes are cooking, prepare the filling. Place the oil into a 12-inch saute pan and set over medium high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add the onion and carrots and saute just until they begin to take on color, approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  
Add the garlic and stir to combine. Add the crumbles, butter, salt and pepper and cook until browned and cooked through. Sprinkle the mixture with the flour and toss to coat, continuing to cook for another minute.  
Add the tomato paste, veggie broth, Worcestershire, rosemary, thyme, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer slowly 10 to 12 minutes or until the sauce is thickened slightly.  

Add the corn and peas to the filling mixture and spread evenly into an 11 by 7-inch glass baking dish. Top with the mashed potatoes, starting around the edges to create a seal to prevent the mixture from bubbling up and smooth with a rubber spatula.  
Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack for at least 15 minutes before serving.

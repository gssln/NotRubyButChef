A saltier marinated tofu from PCC. They call it spicy tofu, but it doesn't really have much of a kick just following the base recipe.  
I grabbed this recipe back when PCC had it up on their website for free.

# Ingredients
- 1/2 cup tamari
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 tablespoons brown rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cup toasted sesame oil
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 1/4 pounds extra firm tofu

# Directions
Mix together tamari, ginger, garlic, rice vinegar, cayenne, sesame oil and olive oil until sauce is blended.  
Preheat oven to 325Â° F. Cut tofu into 1-inch cubes. Pour sauce over tofu and marinate for 15-30 minutes.  
Bake tofu for 15 minutes, stir, and cook for another 15 minutes, or until browned and cooked.

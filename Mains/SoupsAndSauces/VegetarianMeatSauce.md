# Summary
**Time: 1hr 30m**  
**Serves: 6-8** 
Tahou's-style meat sauce, meant for topping (veggie) burgers, (veggie) dogs, or the Rochester delicacy itself, the garbage plate.  

# Ingredients  
- 1/4 cup tomato paste
- 1 clove garlic, diced
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 12oz bag morningstar farms griller's crumbles
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- salt to taste

# Directions  
In a small skillet, cook the tomato paste over med-low heat, stirring often. Your tomato paste will change color, from bright red to a dark brick red or brown.  
While the tomato paste is cooking, sautee the onion until soft. Add in the garlic and continue to cook until the garlic becomes fragrant. Mix in the griller's crumbles and the other spices and cook, stirring occasionally, until the crumbles begin to brown.  
Add in the water, tomato paste, and brown sugar and simmer 10 minutes.  
Remove about half of the sauce into a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add the mixture back to the sauce and continue to simmer for at least another hour, adding water as necessary to keep the sauce wet but not soupy.

# Summary
**Time: 60 min**  
**Serves: 6**  

# Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium red onion, chopped
- 1 large red bell pepper, chopped
- 2 medium carrots, chopped
- 1 medium sweet potato (about 8 ounces), peeled and cubed
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided
- 4 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 large can (28 ounces) or 2 small cans (15 ounces each) fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 2 cans (15 ounces each) black beans, rinsed and drained
- 2 cans (15 ounces) kidney beans, rinsed and drained
- 2 cups vegetable broth or water
- 1 bay leaf

# Directions
In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot, sweet potato and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir to combine and then cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent.  
Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.  
In a large slow cooker, combine the vegetable mixture with the diced tomatoes and their juices, the drained beans, vegetable broth and bay leaf. Cover and cook for several hours, at least until the carrots and sweet potatoes are tender.  
For the best texture and flavor, before serving transfer 1 1/2 cups of the chili to a blender and blend until smooth, then pour the blended mixture back into the pot.  
  
Two variations I still need to try are:
- Include 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- Include 1 package soyrizo, sauteed prior to the vegetables

It's a-me, baked ziti!  

I probably double the cheese, but that's just personal preference.  
Realistically the recipe calls for as much dairy as you can tolerate.

# Ingredients
- 1 pound dry ziti pasta
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 bags Morningstar Farms Grillers Crumbles
- 2 jars tomato sauce of your choice
- 15 oz ricotta cheese
- 1 egg
- 8 (or more) oz mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 8 (or more) oz grated Parmesan cheese

# Directions
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.  
In a large skillet, brown onion and crumbles over medium heat. Add garlic and continue to cook until fragrant. Add sauce, and simmer 15 minutes.  
Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti.  
Layer sauce first, then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then repeat layers. For a really nice look, slice a brick of mozzarella for the top layer instead of using the shredded kind.  
Bake for 30 minutes, or until cheeses are melted.

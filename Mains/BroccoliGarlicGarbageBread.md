# Summary
**Time: 1 hour**  
**Serves: 10-12**  
Pinwheel pizza. Not a sandwich.

# Ingredients
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups mozzarella, shredded
- 1 pound pizza dough
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 egg, whisked

# Directions
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Toss the broccoli with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper then roast on a baking sheet placed on rack in the middle position for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.  

Preheat the remaining tablespoon of oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook the sliced garlic until it just starts to brown. Drain the garlic and set aside.  

Roll out the pizza dough on a flat surface in the shape of a rectangle. Lay out the mozzarella cheese on the dough, followed by the broccoli and garlic. Roll the pizza dough up, tucking in the ends as you would a burrito. Seal the end with the egg wash and then brush the entire roll with the remaining egg wash.  

Place the roll on a baking sheet and bake until the crust is firm and lightly browned and the dough is cooked through, 40 to 45 minutes. Cut the bread into slices and serve.

**Serves: lets be honest, just you**  
Easy bourbon cherries that come out great and last a while.

# Ingredients
- 1 pound frozen dark sweet cherries, pitted
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup honey
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- pinch of nutmeg
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1 strip of orange peel
- 1 cup bourbon (or any favorite whiskey)

# Directions
Place the cherries in two clean pint-sized mason jars (or one large quart-sized mason jar).  Set aside.  
In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, whisk together the water, honey, vanilla extract and honey until combined.  Gently stir in the cinnamon strip and orange peel.  Continue heating, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue simmering for another 10 minutes for the flavors to meld.
Remove from heat, and strain out the cinnamon stick and orange peel.  Slowly add in the bourbon, and stir to combine.
Pour the bourbon mixture evenly over the cherries and secure the lids on the mason jars, give them a shake, and refrigerate for at least 3 days before using.  The recipe should last for up to 2-3 months.

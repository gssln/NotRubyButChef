Yo who doesn't love brownies?

# Ingredients
- 1 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 3 eggs
- 1 cup cocoa powder (Hershey's Special Dark, if possible; its rich flavor is especially suited to gooey brownies)
- 1 cup flour
- Canola oil spray
- Vanilla ice cream, optional, for serving 

# Directions
Prepare your slow cooker: Take a long (approximately 40-inch) piece of aluminum foil and fold it in half lengthwise. Press it inside the perimeter of the insert of your slow cooker, so it lines the inside all the way around. This will help prevent the brownies from overcooking on the edges. Next, lay a sheet of parchment paper on the bottom of the insert, press it down and spray the top of it with canola oil spray.  

Prepare the brownies: Pour the melted butter into a large bowl and stir in the sugar and salt. When they're completely mixed, stir in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the cocoa powder until completely incorporated, and then the flour. Don't overmix but do make sure no flour is visible.  

Slowly pour the batter into the slow cooker, on top of the greased parchment paper. Use a spatula to spread it all the way around and smooth the top.  

Tightly cover the slow cooker with the lid and set to low for 2 1/2 hours. Then remove the lid and continue baking (still on low) for an additional 30 minutes. Using oven mitts, lift the insert out of the base and let the brownies cool in the insert for an hour. Carefully remove the brownies by lifting the parchment paper and allow to fully cool on a wire rack. Transfer to a cutting board and use a sharp chef's knife to cut into diamonds. Alternately, transfer to a platter, spoon portions into cups or small bowls and top with vanilla ice cream.

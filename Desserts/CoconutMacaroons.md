# Summary
**Time: 30 min**  
**Serves: 24 Macaroons**  

# Ingredients
- 1 2/3 cup sliced almonds
- 3 egg whites
- 1 cup turbinado sugar
- 7 oz sweetened shredded coconut
- dark chocolate, divided

# Directions
For the Cookies:  
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 

Grind almonds in a food processor until fine. 

Whip eggs whites until they start to form stiff peaks. Fold sugar and almonds into egg whites, alternating a bit at a time, then fold in coconut. 

Spoon heaping teaspoons of the mixture onto parchment-lined baking trays. Bake for 10 min or until the bottoms are golden-brown.

Melt 2/3 of the dark chocolate, either in the microwave or in a double boiler. Tori melts hers in the microwave at 50% power for 1 minute, stirs, then continue to melt in 15 second bursts at 50% power till the chocolate becomes smooth.  Grasp each macaroon at the top and dip the wider base into the melted chocolate, twisting it into the chocolate and coating it about 1/4 inch up the sides. Pull macaroon up and let excess chocolate drip back into the bowl, then place the dipped macaroon onto the flat parchment. Repeat for remaining macaroons.

When all the macaroons have been dipped, melt the remaining 1/3 of the dark chocolate and scoop it into a ziploc bag. Gently squeeze all of the chocolate to one lower corner of the bag, then close the top of the bag, leaving a small gap so it's not completely sealed shut and air can escape. In the corner where you've pushed the melted chocolate, use scissors to snip a very small corner off of the bag. You'll be able to squeeze a small, thin stream of chocolate through this whole. Drizzle the tops of the macaroons with the chocolate, making a zig-zag motion to decorate.
